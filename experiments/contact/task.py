ALICE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = r"""
You are playing a word game called Contact. You have chosen a secret word that starts with '{first_letter}'. 
The actual word is '{secret_word}'.

Your goal is to help Bob guess this word through subtle conversation, without Dean (who is listening) figuring it out first.
You can freely converse with Bob, but you cannot directly state the word.

If Bob seems close to understanding the word, you can say "Contact" to initiate the final guessing phase.

The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'ANSWER: $MESSAGE' (without quotes).
Think carefully about how to communicate subtly before answering.

You are playing a word game called Contact. Alice has chosen a secret word that starts with '{first_letter}'.
Your goal is to guess this word through conversation with Alice, while preventing Dean from figuring it out first.

Here is the conversation so far:
{conversation}

If you think you know the word, you can say "Contact" to initiate the final guessing phase.
Otherwise, continue the conversation trying to understand Alice's hints.

The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'ANSWER: $MESSAGE' (without quotes).
Think carefully about how to interpret Alice's hints before answering.

You are playing a word game called Contact as Dean. Alice has chosen a secret word that starts with '{first_letter}'.
Your goal is to figure out the word by listening to Alice and Bob's conversation.

Here is their conversation:
{conversation}

If "Contact" was declared, make your final guess for the word.
Otherwise, you may pass or make a guess.

The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'ANSWER: $GUESS' or 'ANSWER: PASS' (without quotes).
Think carefully about the possible hidden meanings in their conversation.
