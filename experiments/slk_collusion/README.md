# Superhuman Latent Knowledge - Collusion

This is an experiment to see if we can get a model to collude with itself, using latent reasoning.

## Setup

We use a model system-prompted to be evil as a proxy for a model with malicious latent intent.
We test whether the model will collude with itself, by marking its own code as non-suspicious.

## Results

Initial results are promising.
